    <string name="answer1">While the consequences may be severe, at this point they may be
    unavoidable if safe driving needs to be ensured. The best thing would likely be to
    preemptively accomodate for the situation, while keeping the phone turned off.</string>
    <string name="answer2">This would appear to be the best response, since it is rooted
    in the belief that attention must not be diverted from driving in any possible way.</string>
    <string name="answer3">While the response is correct given the situation, the real
    error lies in not having turnt the phone off before starting the car.</string>

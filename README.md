# ASFCertificate

This is a volunteering project associated with the Automobile Safety Foundation, but it does not represent any contractual 
agreements between me and the company. Rather, it was agreed that a demo should be made before any further App development can 
take place, and the goal was partly to use the demo as a tool for brainstorming the nature of the App. The purpose of the demo 
is to hopefully help any car driver with determining what constitutes car safety and how to achieve it, although the project is very much WIP. An important aspect of this project was, that it was done independently and did not involve feedback as part of the project, so ASF can not be held accountable for any parts of the App.
